# 🛍️ Determining Optimal Pricing for Retail Products

This project aims to identify the optimal pricing strategy for retail products using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal is to maximize revenue and improve pricing decisions by analyzing historical product data, demand patterns, and price sensitivity.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Determining Optimal Pricing for Retail Products.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook including data preprocessing, EDA, modeling, and optimization techniques.
- Dataset: Includes retail product information such as prices, sales, product categories, and historical demand.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Data exploration and visualization of pricing trends.
- Price elasticity and demand analysis.
- Predictive modeling using regression techniques.
- Revenue optimization using machine learning predictions.

## 🛠 Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/retail-pricing-optimization.git
cd retail-pricing-optimization
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
